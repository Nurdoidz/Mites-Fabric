## Introduction

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nurdoidz/Mites-Fabric/1.19.2/doc/MiteInNature.png)

**Mites** are a new species of silverfish that have mutated to become enthralled by certain materials. As they mature,
they adapt their lives to producing more of their favorite item.

We can only speculate on the hows, but some things are clear:

- Not only do mites look different, but they don’t seem to be able to breed with silverfish either.
- Even though mites seem to pick their favorite item based on whatever they encountered first, some mites are born with
  inherent favor for one item over all others.
- Recent experiments with mites isolated from their favorite items demonstrated that they still produce the items,
  disproving earlier theories that mites eat the items. The only factor that seemed to affect their ability was their
  access to honey.

## Get started as a Miteologist

After downloading the mod to your mods folder, craft a **mite inspector**:

Then, find some mites in their known habitat: the **desert**.

Thanks to brilliant miteologists before you, we know a little about mites:

- mites will follow people holding honey
- mites will breed when fed honey
- mites will nibble on placed honey blocks
- after nibbling on honey, mites eventually produce items

Even though you paid a premium price for your mite inspector (and had to assemble it yourself), it’s pretty basic. The _
Mite Inspector Co_ just has a monopoly on mite inspectors. Given that, some features of the tool:

- use the inspector on a mite to observe its behavior
- take a closer look (sneak and use) to make predictions based on its anatomy

We’re so glad to have you on the team. We haven’t heard from the others in a while, so it’s just you for now.
